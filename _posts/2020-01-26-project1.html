<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

<p>Given the recent tremendous expansion of the public educational system in Vietnam with remarkable performance such as nearly universal primary school enrolment and high scores in international standardized tests, this paper concerns the learning gaps between children from more and less advantaged backgrounds and the unequal distribution of education in Vietnam.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Data</h2>

<p>This analysis provides the overall picture of the factors behind the achievement diﬀerences by
    exploiting within-child variation in longitudinal Young Live study data. The rich information of
    family and school input enables many estimation speciﬁcations that accommodate the presence
    of unobserved endowments and input choices that are endogenous concerning endowed mental
    capacity.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

<p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Result</h2>

<p>In general, the paper ﬁnds that caregivers' ability, improvement of access to services,
    and investing in learning supporting devices at home and school positively impact the achievement
    of unprivileged students.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
