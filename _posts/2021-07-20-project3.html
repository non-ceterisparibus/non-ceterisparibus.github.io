<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction</h2>

<p>In this project, I will deal with a fundamental tool of dynamic macroeconomics: 
    dynamic programming. Dynamic programming is a very convenient way of writing a large set of dynamic problems in economic analysis as most of the properties of this tool are now well established and understood. In order to understand the problem, I will ﬁrst solve deterministic inﬁnite-horizon Ramsey Model.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Data</h2>

<p>Open Development Mekong</h5>
    Open Development Mekong (OD Mekong) and related country websites are independent collectors and providers of objective 
    data on development trends in the Mekong Delta</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>GSO is an organization directly under the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) realizing the function as an adviser 
    for the MPI Minister in state management for statistics; conducting statistical activities and providing social and economic information 
    to organizations and individuals domestically and internationally in accordance with the law.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Result</h2>

<p>In general, the paper ﬁnds that caregivers' ability, improvement of access to services,
    and investing in learning supporting devices at home and school positively impact the achievement
    of unprivileged students.</p>

<p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

<p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
