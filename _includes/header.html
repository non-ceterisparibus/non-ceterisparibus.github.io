                    Development as Freedom is an e-chapter on Economics x Data Science, inspired by the book of the same name of Sir Amartya Sen.
                    In this chapter, I step out of theoretical framework's shadow to embark on an adventure that takes place in the Dataverse.
                    Many recent studies in human capital accumulation have focused on identifying how human capital develops from childhood to 
                    adolescence and early adulthood to reduce inequalities by better understanding the mechanism driving gaps.
                    I am focusing on two critical questions: how public investments in human capital should be distributed among children 
                    from disadvantaged backgrounds to reduce inequality and how it is a late remedy for addressing early disadvantage. 
                    Besides, I am also interested in environmental problems, for which I haven't had any formal training. I am practicing my knowledge by 
                    reading and having fun with data and coding.</p>
